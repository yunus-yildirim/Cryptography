Ukraine Live Updates: As Russia Claims Gains in the East, U.S. Warns of a Long Fight
With the grinding war, the economies of both Russia and Ukraine are in distress.
President Volodymyr Zelensky called for pressure on Russia to lift its blockade of Ukraine’s ports to prevent a global food crisis.
Russia’s more than two-month-old invasion of Ukraine has been marred by poor planning, flawed intelligence,
low morale and brutal, indiscriminate violence against civilians.
But while the war has fallen well short of President Vladimir V. Putin’s grand ambitions of decapitating the government in Kyiv,
there is also a harsh reality emerging for Ukraine: Russia is making some significant territorial gains.
The Russian Defense Ministry said Tuesday that its forces in eastern Ukraine had advanced to the border between Donetsk and Luhansk,
the provinces where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukraine’s army for eight years.
The ministry’s assertion, if confirmed, strengthens the prospect that Russia could gain complete control over the region, known as the Donbas,
compared with just a third of it before the Feb. 24 invasion.
